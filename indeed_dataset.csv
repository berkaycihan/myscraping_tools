Job Description Summary: Consumer Product Marketing Manager (P2P)
Job Description:
Job Description: PayPal Consumer / Wallet PMM
PayPal is looking for a Product Marketing Manager, focusing on PayPal consumer wallet experiences. PayPal Wallet and our overall Consumer solution is an important part of empowering consumers to make meaningful decisions in their financial lives across a number of financial, buying, spending, and paying use cases. The PayPal Consumer / Wallet PMM will be responsible for bringing existing and new products for consumers to market, particularly focused in our app, as well as helping evolve the overall strategy to respond to an increasingly dynamic and competitive global market. The PayPal Consumer / Wallet PMM has the opportunity to work with product teams bringing unique and industry-leading products to consumers through the PayPal app, focused predominantly on ‘person to person payments’ (P2P) – including friends & family and good & services - which enables customers to seamlessly move money from friends and family, and everyone in between.
About Product Marketing Role:
PayPal’s product-oriented Product Marketer drives product commercial success as part of the larger product team including, global product managers, global sales, and marketing teams. PMMs are part of the research and inception of consumer insights that drive a product, then create a plan and deliver success through a deep understanding and consistent championing of the needs of global customers. PMMs are a critical voice of the customer in the entire product lifecycle from needs identification and prioritization, through design and release iterations, and finally through the commercial launch and success monitoring. The role of a Product Marketer is comprised of two primary areas of responsibility and activity: inbound and outbound. Both activities help to define, design and ultimately deliver on the promise of the go-to-market plan for PayPal products. From an inbound perspective, the Product PMM continually defines the most important customer needs and opportunities. Product PMM’s actively interact with our Research team to gain a deep understanding of our customer’s needs, as well as any unique country or regulatory requirements. They also help answer priority customer questions and requests, providing deep expertise about our products and how they are best used, appropriately handing off issues and bugs to the global product and support teams. Product PMM’s will constantly collaborate with product management (PM) peers across the globe to distill the set of needs across all countries and regions into an overall set of globally prioritized needs and opportunities. From an outbound perspective, the role will construct and document the go-to-market plan for their product, ensuring successful pilot testing and product feedback. PMM also works closely with Marketing and other functions to design and execute programs that educate our customers and drive demand and sales. And finally, PMM works with finance and analytics on segmentation sizing, and setting business KPIs.
For more than 20 years, PayPal has remained at the forefront of the digital payment revolution. By leveraging technology to make financial services and commerce more convenient, affordable, and secure, our open digital payments platform gives PayPal’s 400 million active account holders the confidence to connect and transact in new and powerful ways. Through a combination of technological innovation and strategic partnerships, PayPal creates better ways to manage and move money, and offers choice and flexibility when sending payments, paying, or getting paid. Available in more than 200 markets around the world, the PayPal platform, including Braintree, Venmo and Xoom, enables consumers and merchants to receive money in more than 100 currencies, withdraw funds in 56 currencies and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in 25 currencies.

CA, Los Angeles


The world of work is changing…short commutes, flexibility, and convenience are the minimum standards employees want when it comes to how they want to work!

At Regus, we are leading the way. We’ve built the world’s largest workspace network so that our customers can work in an office, in a touchdown space, wherever they want…in over 120 countries across the globe!

Join us and help us bring more freedom to people and businesses, while expanding our network. You’ll be able to enjoy a great work life balance and competitive benefits, while growing your career path along the way.


The opportunity

As a Community Associate, you’ll work closely with new and existing customers across a myriad of industries, working to create and maintain your own Regus community within your center, where you will help take care of all the administrative and support needs for your customers…so that your customers can focus on running their business.


A typical day at Regus

You arrive a few minutes before your center opens to make sure everything is ready and check there’s nothing the cleaners have missed.

Customers arrive all throughout the morning. One asks you for a changed WiFi code. Another wants to know if his important package has arrived. A woman needs directions to her meeting room… and can you help her set up the projector and show her where to find a great cup of coffee. You’re off to help her get set-up, as soon as you connect the incoming call to another customer.

The mail arrives. You sort through it while dealing with a whole host of other customer requests, remembering to email the customer from earlier to let him know his package is waiting for him in his mailbox. And that’s lunch.

Early afternoon, you sit down with the Community Manager to discuss the organization of next week’s networking event in your center. You plan and write the invites to customers, then create, print and put-up posters on the noticeboards around the center. To your excitement, the Community Manager is coming around the corner with a prospect (someone interested in joining the Regus community), you share a few details about what makes this space so amazing for your customers and encourage them to join the network soon so they can participate in next week’s networking event – then you head back to finish putting up your posters.

The day is coming to a close. Time to gently ask the large group in meeting room 3 to start wrapping up. You direct them to the nice restaurant you know around the corner, so they can grab a bite and continue their discussion. You ensure everything’s nice and tidy, it’s time to head home.


About you

We’re looking for someone who knows how to manage multiple tasks while providing customers with the best possible service. You also need to be:

A good communicator, with the ability to build strong professional relationships and empathize with people’s needs (Ideally 2+ years of customer service experience)
Happy taking ownership of problems and finding ways to solve them
Positive, enthusiastic and able to adapt to fast-changing situations
Confident using MS Office and other basic IT packages
Legally eligible to work in the Country you are applying within and at least 18 years old


What we offer

On top of a competitive total compensation package, you’ll enjoy:

Work life balance (no standard nights/weekends)
Generous paid time off plans (sick and vacation)
11 Paid Company Holidays per calendar year (in addition to your PTO accrual)
Competitive 401K Program, with a Company match
Affordable and comprehensive health care for all full-time team members (and some plan options for part-timers as well)
A quarterly bonus plan program
A bright and inspiring work environment
Training and development opportunities aligned with great career path opportunities

kwx is an integrated homeownership experience company that puts Keller Williams real estate agents at the center of its world. The spectrum of Keller Williams Realty Inc., Keller Williams Worldwide, Keller Mortgage, Keller Covered, Keller Offers and Keller Manage, provides agents with a seamless experience so they can offer their clients an integrated homeownership experience. Our technology, training and resources give agents more time to build meaningful client relationships.
Every team member is a valued part of one team driven by one mission: to serve agents so they can serve their clients. We’re committed to listening, learning, and responding to our team members and to making kwx and its family of companies a truly great place to work.
Working with kwx is a win-win for agents, their clients and our kwx team.

OUR HISTORY.
In 1983, Keller Williams was a rebel upstart fueled by Gary Keller’s philosophy of “people helping people” and a win-win culture. Its enduring belief system, WI4C2TES (Win-win, Integrity, Customers, Commitment, Communication, Creativity, Teamwork, Trust, Equity, and Success) keeps them anchored in doing the right thing. The company started to fuel entrepreneurial agents’ success, so agents can serve their clients like no others in the industry.

As Keller Williams grew to a market-leading organization, its culture spread, as did the commitment to give agents the training and tools to grow their businesses and profits. Keller Williams’ proud past set a foundation for a bright future.

As time went on, Keller Williams expanded its offerings to support their agents. While it started with Keller Williams Realty, Inc., it soon expanded with Keller Williams Worldwide and then added supporting services including Keller Mortgage, Keller Covered, and Keller Offers. In 2020, the concept of One Co., integrating all companies for a homeownership experience, took hold and kwx was launched.

OUR LEADERSHIP.
Carl Liebert, a proven executive leader with 30 years of experience leading customer-driven transformations and developing strategic, operational and process excellence within retail organizations joined kwx as CEO in October 2019.

“The opportunity to work within a culture-first organization like KW is a natural fit with my personal and professional values. Our shared passion and commitment to delivering world-class customer experiences at scale made the opportunity to learn and lead alongside Gary Keller a compelling opportunity,” Liebert said. “KW has the market share, the vision and leadership, and unwavering commitment to keep the agent at the center of the holistic homeownership experience.”

Liebert’s focus for the kwx leadership team is to integrate the organization into one team with one mission; grow, engage, and retain the largest, most inclusive agent base; build the best-in-class data strategy and tech platform; build ancillary services and create a superior client experience across the ecosystem.

As a part of the team, you can bring that vision to life. You can guide a team with a greater purpose. You can contribute to agents staying ahead of the game—giving agents what they need to be more efficient, productive, and relevant than the competition.

KELLER WILLIAMS CORE VALUES RESPONSIBILITY: Every member of the Keller Williams leadership team is responsible for leading and modeling diverse, equitable, and inclusive practices in the workplace relative to hiring, promoting, paying, and managing people. Leaders are expected to treat all people with civility, respect, and dignity and demonstrate the 10 core values that form our belief system.
