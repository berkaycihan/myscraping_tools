This individual is hands on, can zoom in and out and has been there and done that. The ideal candidate is completely addicted to growth, darts out of bed in the early a.m. with one’s mind racing with ideas, yet has a proven ability to methodically develop strategy, build a team, execute and deliver results.

Hello, my name is Jeff Braverman, Chief Nut of Nuts.com, and I want to work with you.  I launched Nuts.com while in my college freshman dorm room as a side project. I knew my family had an amazing concept, but I wanted to deliver it digitally to the world.

We spend seven figures per month on paid media. However, for us to hit our goal of becoming a multi-channel billion-dollar revenue brand by 2025, I need to replace myself as the growth/marketing/digital leader.  We’ve built a resilient foundation and now it’s time for someone new to step in to scale things to the next stage and beyond. We need someone who has scaled companies far beyond $50MM in revenue, ideally in the $250MM range, who can bring the wisdom, expertise, network and know-how to hit the ground running, peer around corners and create a growth/digital roadmap that helps us deliver on our goals.
